    "1. Put everything into a dedicated program `encode.c`, to encode every byte from a given data file.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The program shall be called as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "   `encode.exe codero.dat input.txt output.txt`\n",
    "    \n",
    "   The arguments are:\n",
    "      - `code.dat`: a file containing the code to be used (known as the \"codebook\" file)\n",
    "      - `input.txt`: the file to encode\n",
    "      - `output.txt`: the output (encoded) file\n",
    "   \n",
    "   <br>\n",
    "   The codebook file contains a vector of 256 elements of the following structure type:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   <br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "        typedef struct \n",
    "        {\n",

    "        } CODE32BIT;\n",
    "   <br>\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The program will follow the following steps:\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - Allocate an array named `out` of `unsigned char` of max size 10MB (i.e. 10000000 bytes);\n",
    "    - Open and read the full vector from the codebook file;\n",
    "    - Then, open the input file and read every byte in a loop. For each byte do the following:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - Write the codeword for the byte, bit by bit, in the `out` vector. Use the `VECWRITE_BIT()` macro\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - Keep track of the number of bits written, in order to continue writing from where the previous codeword stopped.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Write the array `out` to the output file, as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - Open the output file for writing\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - Write first the total number of bits\n",
    "        - Write afterwards the vector `out`, but only the number of bytes actually used for coding\n",
    "        - *Note: when decoding the file, we will read back the data in the same order*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encode the file `textro.txt` with the provided codebook `codero.dat`. Check the size of the output file and compute the compression ratio.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Repeat 2. for `texten.txt` with codebook `codeen.dat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Encode a file with the codebook from the other language. Check the size of the output file and compute the compression ratio. Compare\n",
    "with the one using the same language codebook. Which case is better?"
