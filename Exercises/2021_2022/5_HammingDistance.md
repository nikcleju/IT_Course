1. For the following error control code, do the following:
    a. compute the minimum Hamming distance and indicate
    how many errors it can detect and how many errors it can correct, with 
    the nearest neighbor decoding algorithm;
    a. considering two received codewords, $\mathbf{r_1} = 11100$ and 
    $\mathbf{r_2} = 00011$, perform decoding and say if there are errors,
    and if so then correct the errors (find the correct codeword and 
    indicate where the errors are located);
    a. Give an example of errors the code cannot detect, and another
    example of errors it can detect but it cannot correct, using
    the nearest neighbor decoding algorithm.


     Message      Codeword
    ---------   -------------------
    $s_1$           $c_1$ = 00000
    $s_2$           $c_2$ = 10011
    $s_3$           $c_3$ = 11100
    $s_4$           $c_4$ = 00111
    

2. Design a block code consisting of 4 codewords, with minimum codeword length,
which is able to detect 3 errors in a codeword.
