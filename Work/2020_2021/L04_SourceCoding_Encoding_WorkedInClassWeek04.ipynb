    "   `encode.exe codero.dat input.txt output.txt`\n",

    "      - `input.txt`: the file to encode\n",
    "      - `output.txt`: the output (encoded) file\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   The codebook file contains a vector of 256 elements of the following structure type:\n",
    "   \n",

    "   \n",
    "        typedef struct \n",

    "        } CODE32BIT;\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   The program will follow the following steps:\n",
    "   \n",
    "    - Allocate an array named `out` of `unsigned char` of max size 10MB (i.e. 10000000 bytes);\n",
    "    - Open and read the full vector from the codebook file;\n",
    "    - Then, open the input file and read every byte in a loop. For each byte do the following:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - Write the codeword for the byte, bit by bit, in the `out` vector. Use the `VECWRITE_BIT()` macro\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - Keep track of the number of bits written, in order to continue writing from where the previous codeword stopped.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "    - Write the array `out` to the output file, as follows:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - Open the output file for writing\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - Write first the total number of bits\n",
    "        - Write afterwards the vector `out`, but only the number of bytes actually used for coding\n",
    "        - *Note: when decoding the file, we will read back the data in the same order*.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Encode the file `textro.txt` with the provided codebook `codero.dat`. Check the size of the output file and compute the compression ratio.\n",
