## Chapter II: Source coding

### What does coding do?

![Communication system](img/CommBlockDiagram.png){width=35%}

* Why coding?

1. Source coding
    * Convert source messages to channel symbols (for example 0,1)
    * Minimize number of symbols needed
    * (Adapt probabilities of symbols to maximize mutual information)

2. Error control
    * Protection against channel errors / Adds new (redundant) symbols

### Source-channel separation theorem

Source-channel separation theorem (informal):

* It is possible to obtain the best reliable communication by performing the
two tasks separately:

    1. Source coding: to minimize number of symbols needed
    2. Error control coding (channel coding): to provide protection against noise

### Source coding

* Assume we code for transmission over ideal channels with no noise
* Transmitted symbols are perfectly recovered at the receiver

* Main concerns:
    * minimize the number of symbols needed to represent the messages
    * make sure we can decode the messages

* Advantages:
    * Efficiency
    * Short communication times
    * Can decode easily

### Definitions

* Let $S = \left\lbrace s_1, s_2, ... s_N \right\rbrace$ = an input discrete memoryless source
* Let $X = \left\lbrace x_1, x_2, ... x_M \right\rbrace$ = the alphabet of the code
    * Example: binary: {0,1}

* A **code** is a mapping from $S$ to the set of all codewords:
$$C = \left\lbrace c_1, c_2, ... c_N \right\rbrace$$

Message    Codeword
-------    --------
$s_1$        $c_1 = x_1x_2x_1...$
$s_2$        $c_2 = x_1x_2x_2...$
...        ....
$s_N$        $c_N = x_2x_2x_2...$

* Codeword length $l_i$ = the number of symbols in $c_i$

### Encoding and decoding

* **Encoding**: given a sequence of messages, replace each message with its codeword

* **Decoding**: given a sequence of symbols, deduce the original sequence of messages

* Example: at blackboard

### Example: ASCII code

![ASCII code (partial)](img/ASCIIcode.png){width=50%}

### Average code length

* How to measure representation efficiency of a code?

* **Average code length** = average of the codeword lengths:
$$\overline{l} = \sum_i p(s_i) l_i$$

* The probability of a codeword = the probability of the corresponding message
* Smaller average length: code more efficient (better)
* How small can the average length be?

### Definitions

A code can be:

* **non-singular**: all codewords are different
* **uniquely decodable**: for any received sequence of symbols, there is only one corresponding sequence of messages
    * i.e. no sequence of messages produces the same sequence of symbols
    * i.e. there is never a confusion at decoding
* **instantaneous** (also known as **prefix-free**): no codeword is prefix to another code
    * A *prefix* = a codeword which is the beginning of another codeword

Examples: at the blackboard

### The graph of a code

Example at blackboard

### Instantaneous codes are uniquely decodable

* Theorem:
    * An instantaneous code is uniquely decodable

* Proof:
    * There is exactly one codeword matching the beginning of the sequence
        * Suppose the true initial codeword is **c**
        * There can't be a shorter codeword **c'**, since it would be prefix to **c**
        * There can't be a longer codeword **c''**, since **c** would be prefix to it
    * Remove first codeword from sequence
    * By the same argument, there is exactly one codeword matching the new beginning, and so on ...

* Note: the converse is not necessary true; there exist uniquely decodable codes which
are not instantaneous

### Decoding instantaneous codes using the graph

* How to decode an instantaneous code using the graph
  - Start at the root, each bit means go left or go right
  - Illustrate at whiteboard

* Advantage on instantaneous code over uniquely decodable: simple decoding

* Why the name *instantaneous*?
    * The codeword can be decoded as soon as it is fully received
    * Counter-example: Uniquely decodable, non-instantaneous, delay 6: {0, 01, 011, 1110}


### Uniquely decodable codes are non-singular

- Theorem:
    - An uniquely decodable code is non-singular

- Proof: by contradiction
    - Assume the uniquely-decodable code is singular
    - This means some codewords are not unique (two different messages have same codeword)
    - When decoding that codeword, you obviously can't decide which is the corresponding message
    - Contradition: the code is not uniquely decodable
    - So if the code is uniquely-decodable, it must be non-singular

* Note: the converse is not necessary true; there exist some non-singular codes which
are not uniquely-decodable

* Relation between code types:
   * Instantaneous $\subset$ uniquely decodable $\subset$ non-singular

### Existence of instantaneous codes

* When can an instantaneous code exist?

* Kraft inequality theorem:
    * There exists an instantaneous code with $D$ symbols and codeword lengths ${l_1, l_2, \ldots l_n}$
if and only if the lengths satisfy the following inequality:
$$ \sum_i D^{-l_i} \leq 1.$$

* Proof: At blackboard

* Comments:
    * If lengths do not satisfy this, no instantaneous code exists
    * If the lengths of a code satisfy this, that code can be instantaneous or not (there exists an instantaneous code,
    but not necessarily that one)
    * Kraft inequality means that the codewords lengths cannot be all very small

### Instantaneous codes with equality in Kraft

* From the proof => we have equality in the relation
$$ \sum_i D^{-l_i} = 1$$
only if the lowest level is fully covered <=> no unused branches

* For an instantaneous code which satisfies Kraft with equality,
all the graph branches terminate with codewords (there are no unused branches)
    * This is most economical: codewords are as short as they can be


### Kraft inequality for uniquely decodable codes

* Instantaneous codes must obey Kraft inequality
* How about uniquely decodable codes?

* McMillan theorem (no proof given):
    * Any uniquely decodable code **also** satisfies the Kraft inequality:
$$ \sum_i D^{-l_i} \leq 1.$$

* Consequence:
    * For every uniquely decodable code, there exists in instantaneous code
    with the same lengths!
    * Even though the class of uniquely decodable codes is larger than that of
    instantaneous codes, it brings no benefit in codeword length
    * We can always use just instantaneous codes.

### Finding an instantaneous code for given lengths

* How to find an instantaneous code with code lengths $\{l_i\}$
    1. Check that lengths satisfy Kraft relation
    2. Draw graph
    3. Assign nodes in a certain order (e.g. descending probability)

* Easy, standard procedure
* Example: at blackboard

### Optimal codes

* We want to **minimize the average length** of a code:
$$\overline{l} = \sum_i p(s_i) l_i$$

* But the lengths must obey the Kraft inequality (for uniquely decodable)

* So we reach the following **constrained optimization problem**:

$$\begin{aligned} \textbf{minimize } &\sum_i p(s_i) l_i \\
\textrm{subject to } &\sum_i D^{-l_i} \leq 1
\end{aligned}$$

### The method of Lagrange multipliers

* Method of Lagrange multipliers: standard mathematical tool

* To solve the following constrained optimization problem
$$\begin{aligned} \textbf{minimize } & f(x) \\
\textrm{subject to } & g(x) = 0
\end{aligned}$$
	one must build a new function $L(x, \lambda)$ (the **Lagrangean function**):
$$L(x, \lambda) = f(x) - \lambda g(x)$$
	and the solution $x$ is among the solutions of the system:
$$\begin{aligned} & \frac{\partial L(x, \lambda)}{\partial x} = 0 \\
& \frac{\partial L(x, \lambda)}{\partial \lambda} = 0
\end{aligned}$$

* If there are multiple variables $x_i$, derivation is done for each one

### Solving for minimum average length of code

* In our case:
    - The unknown $x$ are $l_i$
    - The function is $f(x) = \overline{l} = \sum_i p(s_i) l_i$
    - The constraint is $g(x) = \sum_i D^{-l_i} - 1$

* (Solve at blackboard)

* The optimal values are:
$$\boxed{l_i = -\log(p(s_i))}$$

* Intuition: using $l_i = -\log(p(s_i))$ satisfies Kraft with equality,
so the lengths cannot be any shorter, in general

### Optimal lengths

* The optimal codeword lengths are:
$$\boxed{l_i = -\log(p(s_i))}$$

* Higher probability => smaller codeword
    * more efficient
    * language examples: "da", "nu", "the", "le" ...
* Smaller probability => longer codeword
    * it appears rarely => no problem
* Overall, we obtain the minimum average length

### Entropy = minimal codeword average length

* If the optimal values are:
$$l_i = -\log(p(s_i))$$

* Then the minimal average length is:
$$\min \overline{l} = \sum_i p(s_i) l_i = -\sum_i p(s_i) \log(p(s_i)) = H(S)$$

* The **entropy** of a source = the **minimum average length** necessary to encode the messages
    * e.g. the minimum number of bits required to represent the data in binary form

### Meaning of entropy

* This tells us something about entropy
    * This is what entropy means in practice
    * Small entropy => can be written (encoded) with few bits
    * Large entropy => requires more bits for encoding

* This tells us something about the average length of codes
    * The average length of an uniquely decodable code must be at least as large
    as the source entropy
    $$H(S) \leq \overline{l}$$

* One can never represent messages, on average, with a code  having average length less than the entropy

### Analogy of entropy and codes

* Analogy: 1 liter of water
    * 1 liter of water = the quantity of water that can fit in any bottle
    of size $\geq$ 1 liter, but not in any bottle $<$ 1 liter
    $$Bottle \geq water$$
    * Information of the source = the water
    * The code used for representing the messages = the bottle that carries the water
    $$\overline{l} \geq H(S)$$

### Efficiency and redundancy of a code

* **Efficiency** of a code ($M$ = size of code alphabet):
$$\eta = \frac{H(S)}{\overline{l} \log{M}}$$

    * usually $M$ = 2 so $\eta = \frac{H(S)}{\overline{l}}$
    * but if $M>2$ a factor of $\log{M}$ is needed because $H(S)$ in bits (binary)
    but $\overline{l}$ not in bits (M symbols)

* **Redundancy** of a code:
$$\rho = 1- \eta$$

* These measures indicate how close is the average length to the
optimal value

* When $\eta = 1$: **optimal code**

### Optimal codes

* Problem: $l_i = -\log(p(s_i))$ might not be an integer number
    * but the codeword lengths must be natural numbers

* An **optimal code** = a code that attains the minimum average length
$\overline{l} = H(S)$

* An optimal code can always be found for a source where all $p(s_i)$ are powers of 2
    * e.g. $1/2$, $1/4$, $1/2^n$, known as *dyadic distribution*
    * the lengths $l_i = -\log(p(s_i))$ are all natural numbers => can be
    attained
    * the code with lengths $l_i$ can be found with the graph-based procedure


### Non-optimal codes

* What if $-\log(p(s_i))$ is not a natural number?
    i.e. $p(s_i)$ is not a power of 2

* Shannon's solution: round to next largest natural number
$$l_i = \lceil -\log(p(s_i)) \rceil$$

    i.e. $-\log(p(s_i)) = 2.15$ => $l_i = 3$


### Shannon coding

* Shannon coding:
    1. Arrange probabilities in descending order
    2. Use codeword lengths $l_i = \lceil -\log(p(s_i)) \rceil$
    3. ~~Find any instantaneous code for these lengths $^{*}$~~
	3. For every message $s_i$:
        1. compute the sum of all the probabilities up to this message
        2. multiply this value with $2^{l_i}$
		3. floor the result and convert to binary

* The code obtained = a "*Shannon code*"

* Simple scheme, better algorithms are available
    * Example: compute lengths for $S: (0.9, 0.1)$
* But still enough to prove fundamental results


### Average length of Shannon code

Theorem:

* The average length of a Shannon code satisfies
$$H(S) \leq \overline{l} < H(S) + 1$$

### Average length of Shannon code

Proof:

1. The first inequality is because H(S) is minimum length
2. The second inequality:
    a. Use Shannon code:
$$l_i = \lceil -\log(p(s_i)) \rceil = -\log(p(s_i)) + \epsilon_i$$ where $0 \leq \epsilon_i < 1$

    a. Compute average length:
$$\overline{l} = \sum_i p(s_i) l_i = H(S) + \underbrace{\sum_i p(s_i) \epsilon_i}_{< 1}$$
    a. Since $\epsilon_i < 1$ => $\sum_i p(s_i) \epsilon_i < \sum_i p(s_i)  = 1$ \qed

### Average length of Shannon code

* Average length of Shannon code is **at most 1 bit longer** than the minimum possible value
    * That's quite efficient
    * There exist even better codes, in general

* Q: Can we get even closer to the minimum length?
* A: Yes, as close as we want!
    * In theory, at least ... :)
    * See next slide.

### Shannon's first theorem

Shannon's first theorem (coding theorem for noiseless channels):

* It is possible to encode an infinitely long sequences of messages
from a source S with an average length
as close as desired to H(S),
but never below H(S)

\
\

Key points:

  * we can always obtain $\overline{l} \to H(S)$
  * for an infinitely long sequence

### Shannon's first theorem

Proof:

* Average length can never go below H(S) because this is minimum
* How can it get very close to H(S) (from above)?
    1. Use **$n$-th order extension** $S^n$ of S
    2. Use Shannon coding for $S^n$, so it satisfies
$$H(S^n) \leq \overline{l_{S^n}} < H(S^n) + 1$$
    3. But $H(S^n) = n H(S)$, and average length **per message of $S$** is
$$\overline{l_{S}} = \frac{\overline{l_{S^n}}}{n}$$
because messages of $S^n$ are just $n$ messages of $S$ glued together
    4. So, dividing by $n$:
$$\boxed{H(S) \leq \overline{l_{S}} < H(S) + \frac{1}{n}}$$
    5. If extension order $n \to \infty$, then
$$\overline{l_{S}} \to H(S)$$ \qed

### Shannon's first theorem

* Analogy: how to buy things online without paying for delivery :)
    * FanCourier taxes 15 lei per delivery
        * not efficient to buy something worth a few lei
    * How to improve efficiency? Buy $n$ things bundled together!
    * The delivery cost **per unit** is now $\frac{15}{n}$
    * As $n \to \infty$, the delivery cost per unit $\to 0$
        * What's 15 lei when you pay $\infty$ lei...

### Shannon's first theorem

Comments:

 * Shannon's first theorem shows that we can approach H(S)
 to any desired accuracy using extensions of large order of the source
     * This is not practical: the size of $S^n$ gets too large for large $n$
     * Other (better) algorithms than Shannon coding are used in practice to approach $H(S)$



### Coding with the wrong code

* Consider a source with probabilities $p(s_i)$
* We use a code designed for a different source: $l_i = -\log(q(s_i))$
* The message probabilities are $p(s_i)$ but the code is designed for $q(s_i)$
\

* Examples:
    * design a code based on a sample data file (like in lab)
    * but we use it to encode various other files => probabilities might differ slightly
    * e.g. design a code based a Romanian text, but encode a text in English
\

* What happens?

### Coding with the wrong code

* We lose some efficiency:
    * Codeword lengths $\overline{l_i}$ are not optimal for our source => increased $\overline{l}$

* If code were optimal, best average length = entropy $H(S)$:
$$\overline{l_{optimal}} = -\sum{p(s_i) \log{p(s_i)}}$$

* But the actual average length we obtain is:
$$\overline{l_{actual}} = \sum{p(s_i) l_i} = -\sum{p(s_i) \log{q(s_i)}}$$

### The Kullback–Leibler distance

* Difference between average lengths is:

$$\overline{l_{actual}} - \overline{l_{optimal}} = \sum_i{p(s_i) \log(\frac{p(s_i)}{q(s_i)})} = D_{KL}(p || q)$$

* The difference  = **the Kullback-Leibler distance** between the two distributions
    * is always $\geq 0$ => improper code means increased $\overline{l}$ (bad)
    * distributions more different => larger average length (worse)

* The KL distance between the distributions = the number of extra bits used because
of a code optimized for a different distribution $q(s_i)$ than the true distribution
of our data $p(s_i)$

### The Kullback–Leibler distance

Reminder: where is the Kullback–Leibler distance used

* Here: Using a code optimized for a different distribution:
    * Average length is increased with $D_{KL}(p || q)$

* In chapter IV (Channels): Definition of mutual information:
    * Distance between $p(x_i \cap y_j)$ and the distribution of two independent variables $p(x_i) \cdot p(y_j)$
$$I(X,Y) = \sum_{i,j} p(x_i \cap y_j) \log(\frac{p(x_i \cap y_j)}{p(x_i)p(y_j)})$$


### Shannon-Fano coding (binary)

Shannon-Fano (binary) coding procedure:

1. Sort the message probabilities in descending order
2. Split into two subgroups as nearly equal as possible
3. Assign first bit $0$ to first group, first bit $1$ to second group
4. Repeat on each subgroup
5. When reaching one single message => that is the codeword

Example: blackboard

Comments:

* Shannon-Fano coding does not always produce the shortest code lengths
* Connection: yes-no answers (example from first chapter)

### Huffman coding (binary)

Huffman coding procedure (binary):

1. Sort the message probabilities in descending order
2. Join the last two probabilities, insert result into existing list, preserve descending order
3. Repeat until only two messages are remaining
4. Assign first bit $0$ and $1$ to the final two messages
5. Go back step by step: every time we had a sum, append $0$ and $1$ to the end of existing codeword

Example: blackboard

### Properties of Huffman coding
Properties of Huffman coding:

* Produces a code with the **smallest average length** (better than Shannon-Fano)
* Assigning $0$ and $1$ can be done in any order => different codes, same lengths
* When inserting a sum into an existing list, may be equal to another value => options
    * we can insert above, below or in-between equal values
    * leads to codes with different *individual* lengths, but same *average* length
* Some better algorithms exist which do not assign a codeword to every single message
(they code a while sequence at once, not every message)

### Huffman coding (M symbols)

General Huffman coding procedure for codes with $M$ symbols:

* Have $M$ symbols $\left\lbrace x_1, x_2, ... x_M \right\rbrace$
* Add together the last $M$ symbols
* When assigning symbols, assign all $M$ symbols
* **Important**: at the final step must have $M$ remaining values
    * May be necessary to add *virtual* messages with probability 0 at the end of the initial list,
    to end up with exactly $M$ messages in the last step

* Example : blackboard

### Example: compare Huffman and Shannon-Fano

Example: compare binary Huffman and Shannon-Fano for:
$$p(s_i) = \left\lbrace 0.35, 0.17, 0.17, 0.16, 0.15 \right\rbrace$$

### Probability of symbols

* For every symbol $x_i$
we can compute the average number of symbols $x_i$ in a code
$$\overline{l_{x_i}} = \sum_i p(s_i) l_{x_i}(s_i)$$
    * $l_{x_i}(s_i) =$ number of symbols $x_i$ in the codeword of $s_i$
    * e.g.: average number of 0's and 1's in a code
* Divide by average length => probability (frequency) of symbol $x_i$
$$p(x_i) = \frac{\overline{l_{x_i}}}{\overline{l}}$$

* These are the probabilities of the input symbols for the transmission channel
    * they play an important role in Chapter IV (transmission channels)

### Source coding as data compression

* Consider that the messages are already written in a binary code
    * Example: characters in ASCII code

* Source coding  = remapping the original codewords to other codewords
    * The new codewords are shorter, on average

* This means data **compression**
    * Just like the example in lab session

* What does data compression remove?
    * Removes **redundancy**: unused bits, patterns, regularities etc.
    * If you can guess somehow the next bit in a sequence, it means the bit is not really necessary,
    so compression will remove it
    * The compressed sequence looks like random data: impossible to guess,
    no discernable patterns

### Discussion: data compression with coding

* Consider data compression with Shannon or Huffman coding, like we did in lab
    * What property do we *exploit* in order to obtain compression?
    * How does *compressible data* look like?
    * How does *incompressible data* look like?
    * What are the limitation of our data compression method?
    * How could it be improved?

### Other codes: arithmetic coding

* Other types of coding do exist (info only)
	* Arithmetic coding
	* Adaptive schemes
	* etc.

### Chapter summary

* Average length: $\overline{l} = \sum_i p(s_i) l_i$
* Code types: instantaneous $\subset$ uniquely decodable $\subset$ non-singular
* All instantaneous or uniqualy decodable code must obey Kraft:
$$ \sum_i D^{-l_i} \leq 1$$
* Optimal codes: $l_i = -\log(p(s_i))$, $\overline{l_{min}} = H(S)$
* Shannon's first theorem: use $n$-th order extension of $S$, $S^n$:
$$\boxed{H(S) \leq \overline{l_{S}} < H(S) + \frac{1}{n}}$$
    * average length always larger, but as close as desired to $H(S)$
* Coding techniques:
    * Shannon: ceil the optimal codeword lengths (round to upper)
    * Shannon-Fano: split in two groups approx. equal
    * Huffman: group last two. Is best of all.
