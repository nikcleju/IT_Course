
## Chapter IV: Discrete transmission channels

### What are they?

![Communication system](img/CommBlockDiagram.png){width=40%}

* A device that transmits data from one place to another

* The data undergoes **distortions / errors**

* We consider that transmission is instantaneous

### How do they work?

* A random variable $X \in \{x_1, x_2, ...\}$ is put at the input of the channel

* A random variable $Y \in \{y_1, y_2, ...\}$ appears immediately at the output of the channel
    * $Y$ is related to $X$
    
* The receiver wants to find $X$, but can see only $Y$

Naming:

* The inputs $\{x_1, x_2, ...\}$ and outputs $\{y_1, y_2, ...\}$ are called **symbols**

* Symbols $\neq$ messages $s_i$ from the source S
    * The encoder might convert $s_i$ to a different representation
    * Example: source messages = characters, but channel symbols = 0/1 (encoder converts characters to binary)

### What do we want?

* A successful communication = deduce the $X$ which was sent from the $Y$ that was received

\smallskip

* We are interested in **deducing X when knowing just Y**

\smallskip

* Main topic: How much does knowing $Y$ tell us about $X$? 
    * Depends on the relation between them
    * Is the same as how much $X$ tells us about $Y$ (symmetrical)


### Probabilistic description

From a probabilistic point of view:

\smallskip

* A system of two related random variables
    * Input random variable $X \in \{x_1, x_2, ...\}$
    * Output random variable $Y \in \{y_1, y_2, ...\}$
    * It doesn't matter that one is *input* and other is *output*, we just
    care about the relation between the two random variables

\smallskip

* $X$ and $Y$ are *related* probabilistically, but still *random* (because of noise / errors / distortions)
    * All the probabilities are known

\smallskip

* We need to analyze the relation of $X$ with $Y$

### Intuitive examples

* Binary channel with errors
    * Send 0's and 1's, receive 0's and 1's, but with errors

\smallskip

* Pipe
    * Send colored balls over the pipe, but someone may be re-painting them

\smallskip
    
* Grandma calling!
    * She says *"cat"* / *"hat"* / *"pet"*, but sometimes you hear her wrong

\smallskip

* Living near stadium
    * You don't actually see the game, but try to deduce the score from the shouts you hear
 

### Nomenclature

We only deal with discrete memoryless stationary channels

\smallskip

* Discrete: number of input and output symbols is finite

\smallskip

* Memoryless: the output symbol depends only on the current input symbol

\smallskip

* Stationary: the probabilities involved do not change in time

### Systems of two random variables

* Two random variables: $X = \{x_1, x_2, ...\}$, $Y = \{y_1, y_2, ...\}$.
* Example: throw a dice (X) and a coin (Y) simultaneously
* How to describe this system?

A single joint information source:

$$\snIV{X \cap Y}{x_1 \cap y_1}{p(x_1 \cap y_1)}{x_1 \cap y_2}{p(x_1 \cap y_2)}{...}{...}{x_i \cap y_j}{p(x_i \cap y_j)}$$

Arrange in a nicer form (table):

              $y_1$              $y_2$    $y_3$ 
-----------   -----              -----    -----
$x_1$         ...                ...      ...
$x_2$         ...                ...      ...
$x_3$         ...                ...      ...

* Elements of the table: $p(x_i \cap y_j)$

### Joint probability matrix

The table constitutes the **joint probability matrix**:

$$ P(X,Y) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
p(x_1 \cap y_1) & p(x_1 \cap y_2) & \cdots & p(x_1 \cap y_M) \\ 
p(x_2 \cap y_1) & p(x_2 \cap y_2) & \cdots & p(x_2 \cap y_M) \\ 
\vdots & \vdots & \cdots & \vdots \\
p(x_N \cap y_1) & p(x_N \cap y_2) & \cdots & p(x_N \cap y_M) \\ 
\end{bmatrix} $$

$$\sum_i \sum_j p(x_i \cap y_j) = 1$$

* This matrix completely defines the two-variable system 
* This matrix completely defines the communication process

### Joint entropy

* The distribution $X \cap Y$ determines the **joint entropy**:
$$H(X,Y) = - \sum_i \sum_j p(x_i \cap y_j) \cdot \log(p(x_i \cap y_j))$$

* This is the global entropy of the system (knowing the input and the output)


### Marginal distributions

* $p(x_i) = \sum_j p(x_i \cap y_j)$ = sum of row $i$ from P(X,Y)

\smallskip

* $p(y_j) = \sum_i p(x_i \cap y_j)$ = sum of column $j$ from P(X,Y)

\smallskip

* The distributions $p(x)$ and $p(y)$ are called **marginal distributions**
("summed along the margins")

### Examples [marginal distributions not enough]

Marginal distributions don't tell everything about the system:

* Example 1:

$$P(X,Y) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.3 & 0 \\ 
0 & 0.7 &
\end{bmatrix}$$

* Example 2:

$$P(X,Y) = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.15 & 15 \\ 
0.15 & 0.55 
\end{bmatrix}$$

* Both have identical $p(x)$ and $p(y)$, but are completely different
* Which one is better for a transmission?
* Marginal distribution are useful, but not enough. Essential is the 
*relation* between X and Y.

### Bayes formula

$$p(A \cap B) = p(A) \cdot p(B | A)$$

$$p(B | A) = \frac{p(A \cap B)}{p(A)}$$

* "The conditional probability of B **given A** " (i.e. given that event A happened)

* Examples: listen to the lecture 

When A and B are independent events: 
$$p(A \cap B) = p(A) p(B)$$
$$p(B | A) = p(B)$$

* The fact that event $A$ happened doesn't influence $B$ at all

### Three examples 

Examples to help you remember conditional probabilities

* Gambler's paradox

* CNN: [Crippled cruise ship returns; passengers happy to be back](http://edition.cnn.com/2013/02/14/travel/cruise-ship-fire/)

### Channel matrix

Noise (or channel) matrix:

$$P(Y|X) =
\begin{bmatrix}
p(y_1 | x_1) & p(y_2 | x_1) & \cdots & p(y_M | x_1) \\ 
p(y_1 | x_2) & p(y_2 | x_2) & \cdots & p(y_M | x_2) \\ 
\vdots & \vdots & \cdots & \vdots \\
p(y_1 | x_N) & p(y_2 | x_N) & \cdots & p(y_M | x_N) \\
\end{bmatrix} $$

* Defines the probability of an output **given an input**
* Each row  = a separate distribution that indicates the probability of the outputs
**if the input is $x_i$**

* The sum of each row is 1 (there must be some output if the input is $x_i$

### Relation of channel matrix and joint probability matrix

* $P(Y|X)$ is obtained from $P(X,Y)$ by dividing every row to its sum ($p(x_i)$)

\smallskip

* This is known as *normalization* of rows

\smallskip

* $P(X,Y)$ can be obtained back from $P(Y|X)$ by multiplying each row with $p(x_i)$

\smallskip

* $P(Y|X)$ contains less information than $P(X,Y)$
    * it doesn't tell us the probabilities $p(x_i)$ anymore

### Definition of a discrete transmission channel

**Definition**: A discrete transmission channel is defined by three items:

 1. The input alphabet $X = \{ x_1, x_2, \ldots \}$
 
 \smallskip
 
 2. The output alphabet $Y = \{y_1, y_2, \ldots \}$
 
 \smallskip
 
 3. The noise (channel) matrix $P(Y|X)$ which defines the conditional probabilities of 
 the outputs $y_j$ for every possible input $x_i$

### Graphical representation of a channel

* Nice picture with arrows :)

### Intuitive examples

* Postal service

* Play and win the lottery
    * $+$ funny joke

### Conditional entropy H(Y|X) (mean error)

* Since each row in $P(Y|X)$ is a distribution, each row has an entropy

\smallskip

* Entropy of row $x_i$:
$$H(Y|x_i) = -\sum_j p(y_j|x_i) \log(p(y_j|x_i))$$

* $H(Y|x_i)$ = *"The uncertainty of the output symbol when the input symbol is $x_i$"*

\smallskip

* Example: lottery

### Conditional entropy H(Y|X) (mean error)

* There may be a different value $H(Y|x_i)$ for every $x_i$
* Compute the average over all $x_i$:
$$\begin{aligned}
H(Y|X) &= \sum_i p(x_i) H(Y|x_i) \\
       &= -\sum_i \sum_j p(x_i) p(y_j|x_i) \log(p(y_j|x_i)) \\
       &= -\sum_i \sum_j p(x_i \cap y_j) \log(p(y_j|x_i))
\end{aligned}$$
* $H(Y|X)$ = **"The uncertainty of the output symbol when we know the input symbol"** (any input, in general)
* Also known as **average error**

### Equivocation matrix

Equivocation matrix:

$$P(X|Y) =
\begin{bmatrix}
p(x_1 | y_1) & p(x_1 | y_2) & \cdots & p(x_1 | y_M) \\ 
p(x_2 | y_1) & p(x_2 | y_2) & \cdots & p(x_2 | y_M) \\ 
\vdots & \vdots & \cdots & \vdots \\
p(x_N | y_1) & p(x_N | y_2) & \cdots & p(x_N | y_M) \\
\end{bmatrix}$$

* Defines the probability of an input **given an output**
* Each column  = a separate distribution that indicates the probability of the inputs
**if the output is $y_j$**

* The sum of each column is 1 (there must be some input if the output is $y_j$

### Relation of equivocation matrix and joint probability matrix

* $P(X|Y)$ is obtained from $P(X,Y)$ by dividing every column to its sum ($p(y_j)$)

\smallskip

* This is known as *normalization* of columns

\smallskip

* $P(X,Y)$ can be obtained back from $P(X|Y)$ by multiplying each column with $p(y_j)$

\smallskip

* $P(X|Y)$ contains less information than $P(X,Y)$
    * it doesn't tell us the probabilities $p(y_i)$ anymore

### Conditional entropy H(X|Y) (equivocation)

* Since each column is a distribution, each column has an entropy
\smallskip

* Entropy of column $y_j$:
$$H(X|y_j) = -\sum_i p(x_i|y_j) \log(p(x_i|y_j))$$

* $H(X|y_j)$ = *"The uncertainty of the input symbol when the output symbol is $y_j$"*

### Conditional entropy H(X|Y) (equivocation)

* A different $H(X|y_j)$ for every $y_j$
* Compute the average over all $y_j$:
$$\begin{aligned}
H(X|Y) &= \sum_j p(y_j) H(X|y_j) \\
       &= -\sum_i \sum_j p(y_j) p(x_i|y_j) \log(p(x_i|y_j)) \\
       &= -\sum_i \sum_j p(x_i \cap y_j) \log(p(x_i|y_j))
\end{aligned}$$
* **"The uncertainty of the input symbol when we know the output symbol"** (any output, in general)
* Also known as **equivocation**
* Should be small for a good communication

### Properties of conditional entropies

For a general system with two random variables $X$ and $Y$:

* Conditioning always reduces entropy:
$$H(X|Y) \leq H(X)$$
$$H(Y|X) \leq H(Y)$$
(knowing something cannot harm)

* If the variables are independent:
$$H(X|Y) = H(X)$$
$$H(Y|X) = H(Y)$$
(knowing the second variable does not help at all)

### Mutual information I(X,Y)

* Mutual information I(X,Y) = the average information that one variable has about the other
* Mutual information I(X,Y) = the average information that is transmitted on the channel
* Consider a communication channel with $X$ as input and $Y$ as output:
    * We are the receiver and we want to find out the $X$
    * When we don't know the output: H(X)
    * When we know the output: H(X|Y)
* How much information was transmitted?
    * Reduction of uncertainty: 
    $$I(X,Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y)$$
    
### Mutual information I(X,Y)
$$\begin{aligned}
I(X,Y) &= H(X) - H(X|Y) \\
       &= -\sum_i p(x_i) \log(p(x_i)) + \sum_i \sum_j p(x_i \cap y_j) \log(p(x_i|y_j)) \\
       &= -\sum_i \sum_j p(x_i \cap y_j) \log(p(x_i)) + \sum_i \sum_j p(x_i \cap y_j) \log(p(x_i|y_j)) \\
       &= \sum_i \sum_j p(x_i \cap y_j) \log(\frac{p(x_i|y_j)}{p(x_i)}) \\
       &= \sum_i \sum_j p(x_i \cap y_j) \log(\frac{p(x_i \cap y_j)}{p(x_i)p(y_j)}) \\
\end{aligned}$$

### Properties of mutual information
Mutual information $I(X,Y)$ is:

* commutative: $I(X,Y) = I(Y,X)$
* non-negative: $I(X,Y) \geq 0$
* a special case of the Kullback–Leibler distance (relative entropy distance)

### Relation to Kullback-Leibler distance

* $I(X,Y)$ is a special case of the Kullback-Leibler distance
$$D_{KL}(P||Q) = \sum_i p(s_i) \log(\frac{p(s_i)}{q(s_i)})$$

* In our case, the distributions are:
    * $p(s_i) = p(x_i \cap y_j)$  = joint distribution of $X$ and $Y$ our system
    * $q(s_i) = p(x_i) \cdot p(y_j)$ = joint distribution when $X$ and $Y$ are independent
$$I(X,Y) = D_{KL}(p(x_i \cap y_j) || p(x_i) \cdot p(y_j))$$

* Interpretation
    * When $X$ and $Y$ are independent, mutual information $I(X,Y) = 0$
    * Our mutual information = how far away are from being independent
    * Example: height of a point = how far is it from the point of 0 height


### Relations between the informational measures

* Nice picture with two circles :)
* All six: $H(X)$, $H(Y)$, $H(X,Y)$, $H(X|Y)$, $H(Y|X)$, $I(X,Y)$
* All relations on the picture are valid relations:

$$H(X,Y) = H(X) + H(Y) - I(X,Y)$$
$$H(X,Y) = H(X) + H(Y|X) = H(Y) + H(X|Y)$$
$$I(X,Y) = H(X) - H(X|Y) = H(Y) - H(Y|X)$$
...

* If know three, can find the other three
* Simplest to find first H(X), H(Y), H(X,Y) ---> then find others

### Types of communication channels

1. Channels with zero equivocation
$$ H(X|Y) = 0$$
    * Each column of the noise (channel) matrix contains only one non-zero value
    * No doubts on the input symbols when the output symbols are known
    * All input information is transmitted
$$ I(X,Y) = H(X)$$

* Example: codewords...

### Types of communication channels

2. Channels with zero mean error
$$H(Y|X) = 0$$
    * Each row of the noise (channel) matrix contains only one non-zero value
    * No doubts on the output symbols when the input symbols are known
    * *The converse is not necessary true!*

* Example: AND gate

### Types of communication channels

3. Channels uniform with respect to the input

$$H(Y|x_i) = same$$

* Each row of noise matrix contains the same values, possibly in different order
* $H(Y|x_i) = same = H(Y|X)$
* $H(Y|X)$ does not depend on the actual probabilities $p(x_i)$

### Types of communication channels

4. Channels uniform with respect to the output

* Each column of noise matrix contains the same values, possibly in different order
* If the input symbols are equiprobable, the output symbols are also equiprobable

* Attention: $$H(X|y_j) \neq same!$$

### Types of communication channels

5. Symmetric channels

    * Uniform with respect to the input and to the output
    * Example: binary symmetric channel

### Input probabilities are important

* Suppose we have a channel defined by P(Y|X)
* I(X,Y) **depends on the input probabilities $p(x_i)$**
    * For some distribution $p(x_i)$, we get a value of I(X,Y)
    * For a different distribution $p(x_i)$, we get a different I(X,Y)
    
* We want I(X,Y) to be as large as possible

* Questions:
    * what is the largest possible value of I(X,Y) (depending on $p(x_i)$)?
    * For what distribution $p(x_i)$?

### Channel capacity

* What is the maximum information I(X,Y) we can transmit on a certain channel?

* **Definition:** the **information capacity of a channel** is the maximum value
of the mutual information, where the maximization is done over the input
probabilities $p(x_i)$
$$C = \max_{p(x_i)} \; I(X,Y)$$

* i.e. the maximum mutual information we can obtain if we are allowed to
choose $p(x_i)$ as we want

* Use together with definition of $I(X,Y)$:
$$C = \max_{p(x_i)} \; (H(Y) - H(Y|X))$$
$$C = \max_{p(x_i)} \; (H(X) - H(X|Y))$$

### What channel capacity means
* Channel capacity is the maximum information we can transmit on a channel, 
on average, with one symbol
* One of the most important notions in information theory
* Its importance comes from Shannon's second theorem (noisy channel theorem)
* It allows us to compare channels

### Preview of the channel coding theorem

* For transmission with no errors, we use **error coding** of data before transmission
* How error coding usually works:
    * For each $k$ symbols of data, coder appends additional $m$ symbols, computed via some coding algorithm
    * All of them are sent on the channel
    * The decoder detects/corrects errors based on the additional $m$ bits
* Coding rate: $$R = \frac{k}{k+m}$$
    * stronger protection = bigger $m$ = less efficient
    * weaker protection = smaller $m$ = more efficient


### Preview of the channel coding theorem

* A rate is called **achievable** for a channel if, for that rate, there exists a coding and decoding
algorithm guaranteed to correct all possible errors on the channel


#### Shannon's noisy channel coding theorem (second theorem)
For a given channel, all rates below capacity $R < C$ are achievable. All rates
above capacity, $R > C$, are not achievable.

### Channel coding theorem explained

In layman terms:

* For all coding rates $R<C$, there is a way to recover the transmitted data perfectly (decoding algorithm will detect and correct
all errors)
* For all coding rates $R>C$, there is no way to recover the transmitted data perfectly

Example:

* Send binary digits (0,1) on a channel with capacity 0.7 bits/message
* There exists coding schemes with R < 0.7 that allow perfect recovery
    * i.e. for every 7 bits of data coding adds 3 or more bits, on average => $R = \frac{7}{7+3}$
* With less than 3 bits for every 7 bits of data => impossible to recover all the data

### Efficiency and redundancy

* Efficiency of a channel:
$$\eta_C = \frac{I(X,Y)}{C}$$

* Absolute redundancy of a channel:
$$ R_C= C - I(X,Y)$$

* Relative redundancy of a channel:
$$ \rho_C = \frac{R_C}{C} = 1 - \frac{I(X,Y)}{C} = 1 - \eta_C$$


### Computing the capacity

* Tricks for easier computation of the capacity
* Channel is uniform with respect to the input:

    * $H(Y|X)$ does not depend on the actual probabilities $p(x_i)$
    * $C = \max_{p(x_i)} \; I(X,Y) = \max_{p(x_i)} \; (H(Y) - H(Y|X)) = \max_{p(x_i)} \; (H(Y)) - H(Y|X)$ 
    * Should maximize $H(Y)$

* If channel is also uniform with respect to the output:

    * same values on columns of P(Y|X)
    * $p(y_j) = \sum_i p(y_j|x_i) p(x_i)$
    * if $p(x_i)$ = uniform = $\frac{1}{n}$, then $p(y_j) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i p(y_j|x_i)$ = uniform 
    * therefore $p(y_j)$ are constant = uniform = H(Y) is maximized
    * H(Y) is maximized when H(X) is maximized (equiprobable symbols)

### Computing the capacity

* If channel is symmetric: use both tricks
    * $C = \max_{p(x_i)} \; (H(Y)) - H(Y|X)$ 
    * H(Y) is maximized when H(X) is maximized (equiprobable symbols)
    
### Examples of channels and their capacity

![Noiseless binary channel](img/NoiselessBinaryChannel.png){width=25%}

* Capacity = 1 bit/message, when $p(x_1) = p(x_2) = \frac{1}{2}$

### Noisy binary non-overlapping channel

![Noisy binary non-overlapping](img/NoisyBinaryChannelNonoverlapping.png){width=25%}

* There is noise ($H(Y|X) > 0$), but can deduce the input ($H(X|Y) = 0$)
* Capacity = 1 bit/message, when $p(x_1) = p(x_2) = \frac{1}{2}$

### Noisy typewriter

![Noisy typewriter](img/NoisyTypewriter.png){width=25%}

$$\begin{aligned}
\max{I(X,Y)} &= \max{(H(Y) - H(Y|X))} = \max{H(Y)} - 1 \\
            &= \log(26) - 1 = \log(13)
\end{aligned}$$

### Noisy typewriter

* Capacity = log(13) bit/message, when input probabilities are uniform
* Can transmit 13 letters with no errors (A, C, E, G, ...)

### Binary symmetric channel

![Binary symmetric channel (BSC) ](img/BSC.png){width=25%}

* Capacity = $1 - H_p$ = $1 + p \log(p) + (1-p) \log(1-p)$
* Capacity is reached when input distribution is uniform

### Binary erasure channel

![Binary erasure channel](img/BinaryErasureChannel.png){width=25%}

* Different from BSC: here we know when errors happened\
* Capacity = $1 - p$
* Intuitive meaning: lose $p$ bits, remaining bits = capacity = $1-p$

### Symmetric channel of $n$-th order

![$N$-th order symmetric channel](img/NthSC.png){width=25%}

* Extension of binary symmetric channel for $n$ symbols
* $1-p$ chances that symbol has no error
* $p$ chances that symbol is changed, uniformly to any other (N-1) symbols ($\frac{p}{N-1}$ each)

### Symmetric channel of $n$-th order

* Channel is symmetric => 
$$C = \max_{p(x_i)} \; I(X,Y) = \max_{p(x_i)} \; (H(Y) - H(Y|X)) = \max_{p(x_i)} \; (H(Y)) - H(Y|X)$$
* $\max_{p(x_i)} \; (H(Y))  = \log(N)$
* $H(Y|X) = H(Y|x_i)$ = entropy of any row (same values)

==>

$$C = \log(N) + (1-p)\log(1-p) + p \log(\frac{p}{N-1})$$

* Capacity is reached when input probabilities are uniform

    * I(X,Y) *mutual information*

* Channel capacity: $C = \max_{p(x_i)} \; I(X,Y)$

* Examples:
    * Binary symmetric channel: $C = 1 - H_p$
    * Binary erasure channel: $C = 1 - p$
    * $N$-th symmetric channel: $C = \log(N) - H(of \; a \; row \; of \; channel \; matrix )$
